# Introduction

For the first lab, I would like you to construct a network. Think about a type of relationship that is interesting, important, etc. and what it connects. Whatever floats your boat. It can be a real example from your life, something fictitious, anything really. The *only* restriction is that it should have <u>at least</u> 20 nodes.

**IMPORTANT**: *read through the instructions completely before deciding what you will choose*.

## Part I

*After making your decision, do the following*:

### A. Describe the network 

  1. Is the network one mode or multi-mode?
  2. What do the points (i.e. nodes) represent? If multiple modes, describe what each mode represents.
  3. What do the ties (i.e. edges) represent?
  4. Are the ties simplex or multiplex? If multiplex, describe what each edge in each edge set represents.
  5. Are the ties undirected or directed? Binary/Weighted/Signed?
  6. What type of edge is it? (social relationship? Interactions? Flow?)
  7. Why did you pick this network?
  8. What is one thing you hope to learn by analyzing this network in more depth?
    
### B. Draw a picture of the network (by hand is fine)

## Part II

After completing Part I, create a new network and repeat Part I on that network.
